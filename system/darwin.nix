  # Docker Configuration Notes:
  # - Docker CLI tools (docker, docker-compose) are managed by nixpkgs in shared.nix
  # - OrbStack and Colima provide container runtime backends
  # - Both tools can coexist and be switched using Docker contexts:
  #
  #   Switch to OrbStack: docker context use orbstack
  #   Switch to Colima:   docker context use colima
  #   List contexts:      docker context ls
  #
  # - OrbStack: Native macOS GUI + CLI, superior performance, commercial license
  # - Colima: CLI-only, good performance, completely free and open-source
  #
  # Usage:
  # 1. Start OrbStack via GUI or: open -a OrbStack
  # 2. Start Colima via CLI: colima start
  # 3. Switch contexts as needed for different projects or testing
